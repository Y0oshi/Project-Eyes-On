## Overview
**Project Eyes On** is a hyper-fast, multi-threaded surveillance tool designed to locate open IP cameras across the globe. It combines two powerful engines:
1.  **Directory Scraper**: Harvests feeds from Insecam.
2.  **Deep Web Dorking**: Uses Google & Yahoo search dorks to find hidden cameras not listed in public directories.

## Features
-   **Unified Intelligence**: Access both scanning engines with a single `/scan` command.
-   **Anti-Blocking System**: automatically switches to **Yahoo Search** if Google blocks requests, ensuring zero downtime.
-   **Hyper-Speed**: Unlocked threads (100x workers) for instant parsing and verification.
-   **Zero-Wait**: Optimization algorithms remove artificial delays for maximum throughput.
-   **Country Targeting**: Target specific regions (e.g., `/country US`, `/country RU`).
-   **Stealth Mode**: Emulates real browser traffic to bypass firewalls.
